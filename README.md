A couple of things to note. 

1. Make sure that the columns match. From left to right it should be "rep_accounts, LAST NAME, FIRST NAME, company_names, GITHUB HANDLE, JOB TITLE, COUNTRY, TICKET TYPE, ATTENDEE TYPE, REGISTERED DATE""
2. For rep_accounts ensure that you put the main company name there. For example, if an account is called Vanguard_Parent and there are multiple different accounts similar to it like Vanguard_Server, just type Vanguard.
3. Feel free to use GitHub Copilot for troubleshooting if you have any questions on the code. Its free for all GitHub Employees and pretty cool!
